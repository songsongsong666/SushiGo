## Name of Proposed Project
Sushi Go

## Description
### Abstract
[Sushi Go](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go) is a board game usually played by 2-5 people. It involves 108 cards in 8 categories in total. Each game has 3 rounds in a certain mode, where players can choose different cards from category. This project is designed to implement an online version of the game, which offers a platform for a group of players who are distant from each other, or for a single user who wants to play online with other users.

The basic structure of the project is:
1. A Login/Register/User Profile system
2. Single user: match finder OR 2-5 users (friended): create a game
3. Choose Mode
4. 108 cards displayed beautifully
5. Interactions between users in 3 rounds (deal cards, show cards, exchange cards, points calculated)
6. Final result

Among these steps, (4), (5) and (6) are the most important parts in the game. Step (1) and (2) might need some database/back-end technology, and step (3) will require multiple modes implemented. We can implement the first three parts later.

### Intended Users
Sushi Go lovers, especially young people.
